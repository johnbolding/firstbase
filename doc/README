Yes yes yes. There needs to be an info file on firstbase
along with an HTML manual.

For now, the best I can do is to provide the old postscript manual,
fb-manual.ps, along with the large set of man pages, which are current,
but certainly not a substitute for methodical documentation.

To generate a postcript image of the man pages:

   cd ../man
   make man.ps

New documentation will be done. Real Soon Now.
